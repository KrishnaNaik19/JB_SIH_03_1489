            <p>Revathi, born with an innate love for driving, eagerly awaited her 18th birthday to enroll in driving classes, a rarity in the 1970s. Within three weeks, she mastered driving and became unstoppable on Mumbai's roads. Her passion for driving led her to pioneer Asia's first women-only taxi service, ForShe, in 2007. Over the years, Revathi's ventures have empowered over 1,000 girls with skills, lifting families out of poverty. Her latest initiative, HeyDidi, focuses on providing women-driven delivery services, further merging her love for driving with women's empowerment.
